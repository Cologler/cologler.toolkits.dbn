# DateTime by Name

## Why I Make This

Google photo can store images, but it cannot order by filename.

This script is set the sorted datetime to the images.

**This will overwrite exists datetime, so you need to backup your image before you use this.**

## How To Use

``` cmd
python dbn.py [folder]
```
